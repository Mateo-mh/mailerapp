# mailerapp
Using python, html, css, flask, mysql for the database initially, sendgrid, and heroku to load my app, I created a basic app called mailer with the options to send, return, search, and create new mail.

To run this application, all you have to do is access the following link: https://damp-badlands-25408.herokuapp.com/, since the application is already hosted on heroku

Here is a preview of the application:

By clicking on new mail:

Once an email has been sent, the following view is displayed (the email you see is a test example I've created and sent):
